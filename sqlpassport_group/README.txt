This is the web page for Group 1.
The test site uses Express with its main features (Routing, Templating and Middleware support) with a local mySQL connection. Authentication is handled with PassportJS package, and the templating engine used is EJS.

A username and password that can be used to test:

tien
pass

The website is deployed by running

nodemon app

in this directory

The website isn't always available and may be down at times, however we do try to login and restart nodemon every few hours.

The website also is not secure, we did not have enough time to learn the features and libraries required. However the site is in working order.

Group 1: Tien, Milan, Denis, Duji
